# napjs

A simple CLI Alarm Clock, which uses text to speech to say a message after a specified
amount of time.

### Why

I made this because sometimes I'm in bed with my laptop and I want to take a nap, but
I can't find my phone, don't have an alarm clock near me, and I don't like using online
alarm clocks.

I don't think anyone else has this problem haha.

### Installation

```
npm install -g napjs
```

### Usage

* -t specifies time in seconds
* -m specifies message, default is "wake up"

```
napjs -t 60 -m 'wake up'
```
